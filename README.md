## Introduction

Spiking neural network (SNN) is studied in multidisciplinary domains
to (i) enable order-of-magnitudes energy-efficient AI inference and
(ii) computationally simulate neuro-scientific mechanisms. The lack of
discrete theory obstructs the practical application of SNN by limiting
its performance and nonlinearity support. We present a new
optimization-theoretic perspective of the discrete dynamics of spiking
neurons. We prove that a discrete dynamical system of simple
integrate-and-fire models approximates the sub-gradient method over
unconstrained optimization problems. We practically extend our theory
to introduce a novel sign gradient descent (signGD)-based neuronal
dynamics that can (i) approximate diverse nonlinearities beyond ReLU
and (ii) advance ANN-to-SNN conversion performance in low time
steps. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our technique
achieves (i) state-of-the-art performance in ANN-to-SNN conversion and
(ii) is the first to convert new DNN architectures, e.g., ConvNext,
MLP-Mixer, and ResMLP.

## Installation

### Using VSCode Dev Containers

If you have the Dev Containers extension installed in VSCode:

1. **Open the Command Palette**:
   - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS).

2. **Select**:
   - **"Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"**.

3. **Wait for Setup**:
   - VSCode will rebuild and reopen the project in a containerized environment with all dependencies installed.

### Manual Installation

If you are not using VSCode:

1. **Install Python 3.10**:
   - Download and install Python 3.10 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

2. **Install PyTorch 2.0.1 with CUDA**:
   - Visit [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and select the appropriate command for your system.
   - Example installation command:
     ```bash
     pip install torch==2.0.1+cu117 torchvision==0.15.1+cu117 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snuhcs/snn_signgd
   cd snn_signgd
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install setuptools
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

We provide a minimal example to demonstrate how to use the code.

1. **Navigate to the `examples` Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   ```

2. **Run the Minimal Example Script**:
   ```bash
   python minimal_example.py
   ```
   This script showcases the basic usage of our signGD-based neuronal dynamics for ANN-to-SNN conversion.
